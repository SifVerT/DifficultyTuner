# DifficultyTuner
 
I (try to) keep the latest stable version on main while the latest WIP version might not work at all after compiling, they are not committed as working copies of the mod but I keep the project here on Github for access between different computers of mine. On the other hand, older versions of the mod can be found and they should be the final release of their respective version number.
